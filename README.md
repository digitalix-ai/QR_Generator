# QR_Generator
A QR code generator app

This is a QR code generator program in Python. The modules PIL and qrcode are in use here. The file qr.py contains the app, while the file qr.png contains the generated QR code.
In this particular case, the generated QR code is a link to my portfolio website, but the program can be adjusted to produce QR codes with any text data, including links.
